* Download the tei-annotator.zip from danmccreary.com

* Reached error in Firefox: 
Error loading stylesheet: A network error occured loading an XSLT stylesheet:http://localhost:8888/rest/db/dma/apps/tei-annotator/utils/exsltforms/exsltforms.xsl
	* Possible Solution: Have to edit the Annotator-Specifications.xml
		* For each <AnnotatorIDServiceURI>, have to change URI from REST format to localhost format: /rest/db/dma/apps/ to http://localhost:8888/TEILiteEditor/
		* May need to copy over tei-annotator/ files into root directory
	* Also found REST URI in the TEILiteEditor/plugins/exsltforms/eXSLTFormsConfigOptions.xml
	* Also found REST URI in TEILiteEditor/plugins/xsltforms/xsltforms.xsl
